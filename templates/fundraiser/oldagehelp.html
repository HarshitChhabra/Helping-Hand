            <p><b><i>Happiness is a state of mind:</i></b> The women in oldage homes have been rejected by their own families. Many might be ill. Many might be counting their last days. But the joy and smiles they have on their face could bring all of us to shame who grunt at every tiny displeasure we come across, “Oh damn my laptop crashed! How would I survive now”, “Oh god, my company pays me peanuts, I am the poorest person on earth”, “why do my parents bug me so much when I am out late hours”. What could be more saddening than being rejected by your own family, your own people at an age when you need love and support.If we would love life with all our heart, it would love us back.</p>
            <p><b><i>People don’t need gifts or money, they need your time:</i></b> while we are deeply into our gadgets, busy connecting to the world, we forget that the world at our home is crumbling. How many of us have a hearty laugh or spend an entire day with undivided attention with our parents, spouse, kids, and friends or may be neighbors? There are people who when miss a birthday buy expensive gifts to compensate for their felony. People don’t need gifts they need your time. People there don't value the gifts you give more than the time you spend with them. They are generally exhilarated by the fact that we took a day off from work and spent time with them – eating, playing, dancing and simply sharing love!</p>
            <p><b><i>Help people, strangers too – that’s humanity –</i></b> At oldage homes, there are poeple who are grumpy or simply silent (they do not utter a single word the entire day). But few of them are moving all around, cheering everyone, talking and encouraging them to be a part of the fun day. Their energy is contagious and nobody could say a no to them. That’s what you have when you help people to live, laugh, explore or realize how they can be happy too.</p>
            <p><b><i>How we bid a farewell to the world is in our hands –</i></b> Death is certain. But how do we bid a farewell to the world we lived in, is in our hands. Would it be full of happiness, or flooded with tears, or built on a story of pain and agony. It’s on us how do we write the last closing chapters of our lives. Nobody can predict what bad or good would happen to us, but how do we move on with it is an art to be learned and practiced.</p>
            <p><b><i>Love your parents – I read a beautiful saying on twitter few days back –</i></b> “We are so busy growing up that we forget that our parents are growing old”. We have to understand the pain parents take to bring up their children. They dedicate the most precious thing to their children– TIME. They are available for us through our thick and thin. But when we grow up and it is time that our parents take a break and do some selfish indulgence, we are no longer available for them. Worst many of us feel they are not needed anymore. Love your parents for the sheer fact they have devoted their prime lives for us – unconditionally.</p>
